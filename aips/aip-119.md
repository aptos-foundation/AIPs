# AIP-119 - reduce staking rewards

## summary

adjustments to the APT monetary expansion rate:

- **reduce staking by 1% each month, over the next 3 months, resulting in a 3.79% staking rewards rate

these changes are intended as a first-step to redesigning aptos economics to more effectively support the ecosystem. we propose implementing these changes over 6 months to allow time to assess and mitigate any impacts

## motivation

the primary motivation for this change is the current staking rate is too high discouraging capital efficiency. this change will bring aptos base staking rewards in-line with other layer-1 blockchains [1].

the aptos staking rewards serves as a defi "risk-free" rate, proving a base-rewards on ecosystem participants who lock capital on-chain. similar to the central-banks, aptos governance can modify the "risk-free" staking rate to motivate economic behavior

lower staking rewards encourage participants to seek out opportunities that have associated costs or risks but earn more rewards than the "risk-free" staking rate:

- restaking
- depin infra: RPC, bundles, indexing
- MEV
- alternative sources of defi rewards

however, rewards also serve as an incentive for long-term holding of APT; all things equal, less ecosystem rewards means less incentive to hold APT

we expect this will be offset by (1) the reduction in inflation from this AIP and (2) new rewards generating opportunities launching in the next 6 months


### out of scope

we considered more complex solutions but i believe before deciding on any long-term or complex solution we need more community feedback

## risks and drawbacks

### impact on the validator set

below we se an APT-price sensitivity table for validators with a (common) commission rate of 5%. Based on a survey, the high end of costs for validators is ~35,000$, which is the number we used for the table. (however the cost to spec the hardware on latitude.sh are ~15k)

| stake delegated | profits with 7%;
APT=5$ | profits with 7%;
APT=6$ | profits with 7%;
APT=8$ | profits with 7%;
APT=10$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1M | $-17500 | $-14000 | $-7000 | $0 |
| 3M | $17500 | $28000 | $49000 | $70000 |
| 5M | $52500 | $70000 | $105000 | $140000 |
| 7M | $87500 | $112000 | $161000 | $210000 |
| 9M | $122500 | $154000 | $217000 | $280000 |

there are currently 53 validators with less than 3M APT stake. their total stake is 78,385,658APT, which corresponds to a ~0.09 share of the total 865,000,000 that is actively staked

given this impact on small validators, aptos should consider a community validator program to give grants and stake to small validator contributing to the ecosystem

### impact on decentralization

staking emission provide a mechanism to decentralize stake with stakers with long-term alignment. we believe there should be further discussion on more efficent ways to rewards long-term economic participants such as developers, protocols and users, not just validators 

## Timeline

- week 1-4: Community and foundation review
- week 5: submit proposal to mainnet

## tokenomics overview

significant expansion rates are used to bootstrap a blockchain, with the predominant necessity of incentivizing validators and early infrastructure building. We focus here on the monetary expansion due to staking rewards. nn our case, most of the newly minted tokens go to the FDN (FDN/Labs own more than 90% of the staked APT). aptos validators typically enjoy substantial grant delegations and live on commissions. this implies that, in practice, validators mostly benefit from the cost-of-capital (which is free to them). for example, given the current expansion rate of ~7%, a delegation grant of ~10M APT ([at least 30 validators have more than 10M APT](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/Validators?network=mainnet)), and a commission of ~7%, a validator is making ~49,000 APT annually. taking into consideration that yearly costs for a professional validator are ~30,000$, this leaves them with a hefty profit

often, staking rewards are substantially lower than other DeFi options (e.g., [lending](https://app.ariesmarkets.xyz/lending) or liquidity providing), so competing purely on rewards is less likely. on the other hand, staking on aptos does not require taking on risk, with a relatively short lockup


## further discussion

### how to further incentivize validators?

1. give the priority gas from the block to validators [burn or split base gas](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md)
2. [foundation delegation program](https://solana.org/delegation-program)
3. [bundles, block-building APIs](https://jito-foundation.gitbook.io/mev/solana-mev/jitos-mev-priorities)

### how to further incentivize ecosystem?

these previous rewards going to staker could be shifting to incentivize other key L1 metrics such as: liquidity, gas subsidies, grants

additionally we should put thought into how to incentivize additional validator metrics such as community participation, geographic distribution and figuring out how to scale the satoshi coefficient into the thousands on high-performance hardware 

### next generation economics?

proof-of-liquidity, restaking
