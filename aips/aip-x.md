# AIP-X - Permissioned Signer

## Summary

Improve the security and usability of signer by allowing to create a permissioned mode signer where users can specify the permissions associated with those signers. Operations that violates those permission setups would be rejected in the transaction.

### Out of scope

We are trying to define a permission standard to specify permissions in the current aptos framework. Despite such standard could be extended to any modules on blockchain, we will be limiting our focus on the aptos framework only so that we can iterate on this standard faster.

## High-level Overview

Right now Move on Aptos has one single permission that is represented as signer. 

- Smart contract uses `signer` to identify who authenticate this operation. Typical code would look like `let addr = signer::address_of(x)`  and use `addr`  as the issuer for this operation.
    - e.g: framework code  will use `signer`  to determine which account issued the withdraw
- Smart contract needs `signer` to move items into/away from account.

This results in a huge security concern:

- Different smart contract uses the same `signer`  to authenticate an operation. This means that a malicious smart contract can pass the `signer`  to another module and perform the operation on user’s behalf without being acknowledged by the user.
- `signer`  could also be abused to inflate your account.

We need to design a solution such that:

- Move modules should be able to
    - define permissions
    - Framework/transaction can set those permissions
- Transactions that tries to execute operations that are not included in the list needs to be aborted and rejected by the Aptos VM.
    - Work with our existing signer module so that users can still set constraints on what transactions invoking existing on chain move functions could invoke.


## Impact

This would be a full compatible change to the framework. Existing on chain move modules wouldn't be impacted. We will add those constraints to the Aptos Framework around popular asset types, i.e: Coin/FungibleAsset/Object/NFT.

## Alternative Solutions

Another way to enforce permission is to leverage AIP-56 the runtime access control engine in Move. However, the runtime access control is more suitable to provide coarse grained permissions around modules but it's hard to represent permissions such as withdrawing X APT from a signer. However, we are open to encoperate the changes to the Move on Aptos language extensions in the future if we want to extend the permission system to the general public.


## Specification and Implementation Details
Currently, a signer is a single wrapper around an address to represent that the signature of the transaction passes the address authentication logic. We would like to extend the notion of existing signers in the Move VM so that we could provide APIs to manage contextual data  embedded in such extended signer.

### Lifecycle of a permissioned handle

The lifecycle of the new signer will look like the following:

```jsx
module aptos_framework::permissioned_signer {
    struct PermissionedHandle {
        master_addr: address,
        permission_addr: address,
    }

    public fun create_permissioned_handle(
        master: &signer,
    ): PermissionedHandle;

    public fun signer_from_permissioned(p: &PermissionedHandle): signer;

    public fun destroy_permissioned_handle(p: PermissionedHandle);

    public fun is_permissioned_signer(s: &signer): bool;
}
```

We would introduce a new struct called `PermissionedHandle` that is derived from the original signer. The handle is generated by `create_permissioned_handle_with_expiration`  API, which takes an original signer. In that handle, we will generate a fresh address using auid API to store the permission information that would be needed by the management API.

Once we have the handle, we can then invoke `signer_from_permissioned`  to obtain a permissioned signer value. The invariant would be that the address of the permissioned signer should be exactly the same as the existing master signer that is used to derive the handle. With the expiration date, this API would abort if the wall clock time has exceeded the expiration date. Also the handle should not be storable. The storable variant will need to follow the logic of account delegation. The handle is also not droppable, so that we can enforce the destruction logic by using `destroy_permissioned_handle`  API.

Note that this handle does not have store capability. There will be storable variant of this handle as well but that would contain an expiry time and the creation of this handle can only be invoked in the Aptos Framework as this is equivalent to signer delegation and thus need special security measure.

### VM Representation of the new signer

Since the signer is not storable, we should have the freedom to change the internal representation of a signer. The new signer will roughly look like the following in the VM:

```rust
enum Signer {
    Master(AccountAddress),
    Permissioned {
        master_addr: address,
        permission_addr: address,
    }
}
```

Note that we did change the serialization rules for signer which would be a non-backward compatible change. This should be fine in general as signer should not be storable. The only problem is we exposes `size_of_val`  API in our framework. Since we changed the serialization, this would break the existing semantics for this API. To mitigate this, we will manually make sure that  `size_of_val`  would calculate the size of signer to be a single account address instead of an address plus a variant.

### Managing permissions

The management API would look like the following:

```jsx
module aptos_framework::permissioned_signer {
    public fun authorize<PermKey: copy + drop + store>(
        master: &signer,
        permissioned: &signer,
        capacity: u256,
        perm: PermKey
    );

    public fun check_permission_exists<PermKey: copy + drop + store>(s: &signer, perm: PermKey)

    public fun check_permission_capacity_above<PermKey: copy + drop + store>(
        s: &signer, threshold: u256, perm: PermKey
    )

    public fun check_permission_consume<PermKey: copy + drop + store>(
        s: &signer, weight: u256, perm: PermKey
    )
}
```

The master signer can use `authorize`  to grant permissions to a permissioned signer. The smart contracts would use the `check_` APIs to make sure if a permissioned signer is provided, it needs to have the right permission granted by the master signer to perform the corresponding operation.

In the current design, the permission storage is a `CopyableAny -> u256`  mapping stored in the global storage. Smart contract can define the key themselves to create proper domain separation and act as witness pattern.

### Revoking Permission

The master signer should be able to revoke the permission granted to a permissioned signer at any time. The API would look like the following:

```jsx
module aptos_framework::permissioned_signer {
    public fun revoke_permission_handle(master: &signer, permission_address: address);
}
```

The `signer_from_permissioned` would abort on revoked signer.

### Example: Fungible Asset Transfer Limit
```jsx
module aptos_framework::fungible_asset {
    struct WithdrawPermission has store {
        token_addr: address,
    }

    public fun withdraw<T: key>(owner: &signer, store: Object<T>, amount: u64): FungibleAsset {
        assert!(
            permissioned_signer::check_permission(
                owner,
                amount as u256,
                WithdrawPermission {
                    metadata_address: object::object_address(&borrow_store_resource(&store).metadata)
                }
            ),
            error::permission_denied(EWITHDRAW_PERMISSION_DENIED)
        );
        //… regular withdraw logic
    }
    
    public fun grant_permission(
        master: &signer,
        permissioned: &signer,
        token_type: Object<Metadata>,
        amount: u64
    ) {
        permissioned_signer::authorize(
            master,
            permissioned,
            amount as u256,
            WithdrawPermission { metadata_address: object::object_address(&token_type)}
        )
    }
    /// Removing permissions from permissioned signer.
    public fun revoke_permission(permissioned: &signer, token_type: Object<Metadata>) {
        permissioned_signer::revoke_permission(permissioned, WithdrawPermission {
            metadata_address: object::object_address(&token_type),
        })
    }

}

```

## Reference Implementation

We have a stacked PRs in https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/14605. In the stack, we have:
- Implemented the core library that generates and manages the permissioned signer.
    - including Move and Rust components.
- Sweeped throught Aptos Framework codebase with following permissions implemented:
    - how much fungible asset/coin can be withdrawed from each permissioned signer.
    - transfer Object.
    - manipulate NFT object/collection.
    - operations on account.
    - allowed to vote
    - allowed to stake
    - Privileged operation where master signer is required.


## Testing 

Framework unit tests.

## Risks and Drawbacks

The performance in the current code might not be good enough. We need to look into more performance storage data structure for storing permissions.

## Security Considerations

It is crucial for us to review whether the permission checks in Aptos Framework is exhaustive. Otherwise, a permissioned signer can perform operations that escaped the intention at creation process.

## Future Potential

We might want to enable the permissioned signer framework to the general on chain move modules so that they could use this mechanism to develope their own authorization schema.

## Timeline

### Suggested implementation timeline

Implementation done. Under review now.

### Suggested developer platform support timeline

We will need https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/pull/448/files for SDK side support.

### Suggested deployment timeline

Looking into merging into Aptos Framework towards end of October 24.
