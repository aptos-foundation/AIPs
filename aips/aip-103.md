# AIP-103 - Enhanced Transaction Context with Transaction Hash

## Summary

This AIP extends the transaction context module in the Aptos Framework by adding new native functions for accessing transaction hashes within smart contracts. Specifically, it introduces functions for retrieving the raw transaction hash and a unique session hash.

## High-level Overview

This feature extends the transaction context module within the Aptos Framework to provide smart contracts with access to the raw transaction hash of the current user transaction.

Key updates include:

* Raw Transaction Hash: Smart contracts can retrieve the raw transaction hash of the current user transaction. For fee-payer transactions, the hash is calculated with the fee-payer address set to 0x0.
* Unique Session Hash: A new function is introduced to obtain a unique session hash, producing the same result as the existing `get_transaction_hash` function. The original function name could be misleading and easily confused with `raw_transaction_hash`, so this new function essentially serves as a clearer renaming of the existing function.

## Impact
Smart contract developers can leverage this feature to enable their smart contracts to directly access the raw transaction hash value for the current user transaction.

## Specification and Implementation Details (TODO)

This AIP extends the Aptos Framework's transaction context module (i.e., `aptos_framework::transaction_context`) by introducing the followingtransaction context API:
* `public fun raw_transaction_hash(): vector<u8>`
  * Returns the hash of the current raw transaction, which is used for transaction authentication. In the case of a fee-payer transaction, the hash value is generated using 0x0 as the fee-payer address.

* `public fun unique_session_hash(): vector<u8>`
 * Returns a unique session hash, ensuring a distinct value for each Aptos VM session (e.g., prologue, execution, and epilogue). This function replaces the existing function `get_transaction_hash`.

## Reference Implementation
https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/13659

## Testing

The reference implementation includes multiple unit tests and end-to-end tests covering various positive/negative scenarios. These scenarios will be tested on the devnet and testnet.

## Security Considerations

This AIP allows smart contracts to access the information about the transaction currently in execution. Since the user transaction data is already stored on-chain and is publicly available, this AIP does not introduce any additional security risks related to the disclosure of secrete information.

## Future Potential

This feature is essential for enabling custom user prologues and epilogues, which will be detailed in a separate AIP.

## Timeline

### Suggested implementation timeline

The implementation has landed on the `main` branch before the branch cut for v1.23.

### Suggested developer platform support timeline

N.A.

### Suggested deployment timeline

* On the devnet: with release v1.23
* On the testnet and mainnet: depends on the AIP approval process
