# AIP-14 - New cryptography natives for hashing and MultiEd25519 PK validation

## Summary

Include a brief description summarizing the intended change. This should be no more than a couple of sentences.

## Motivation

Describe the impetus for this change. What does it accomplish? What might occur if we do not accept this proposal?

## Rationale

Explain why you submitted this proposal specifically over alternative solutions. Why is this the best possible outcome?

## Specification

Describe in detail precisely how this proposal should be implemented. Include proposed design principles that should be followed in implementing this feature. Make the proposal specific enough to allow others to build upon it and perhaps even derive competing implementations.

## Reference Implementation

This is an optional yet highly encouraged section where you may include an example of what you are seeking in this proposal. This can be in the form of code, diagrams, or even plain text. IDeally, we have a link to a living repository of code exemplifying the standard, or, for simpler cases, inline code.

## Risks and Drawbacks

Express here the potential negative ramifications of taking on this proposal. What are the hazards?

## Future Potential

Think through the evolution of this proposal well into the future. How do you see this playing out? What would this proposal result in in one year? In five years?

## Suggested implementation timeline

When should community expect to see it on devnet

testnet?

On mainnet?
