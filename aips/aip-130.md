# AIP-130 - Signed Integers in Aptos Standard Library

## Summary

This proposal introduces signed integer types (`i64`, `i128`) to the Aptos standard library. Currently, Move only supports unsigned integers, which limits the expressiveness of smart contracts—particularly for financial applications that require negative numbers (e.g., representing debts or funding rates).

The implementation has been developed and tested in an external repository, [0xAnto/move-integers](https://github.com/0xAnto/move-integers), with community contributions. Integrating this into the Aptos standard library will increase visibility, encourage broader usage, and benefit from additional security reviews.

The initial implementation will be written entirely in Move. Once native support for signed integers is introduced, we can replace the current logic with native functions internally. At that point, the `i64` and `i128` modules will serve as wrappers, similar to the [math64](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib/sources/math64.move) and [math128](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/aptos-move/framework/aptos-stdlib/sources/math128.move) modules.

### Current Limitations

In the absence of a standard signed integer library:
- Developers are forced to implement custom workarounds using unsigned integers.
- These solutions are often error-prone, non-optimal in gas usage, and inconsistent across projects.
- Each project ends up re-implementing similar logic, increasing maintenance overhead and introducing audit complexity.


### Out of scope

This AIP does not include changes to the Move VM to natively support signed integers. The implementation will be purely in Move language, with the understanding that:
- Native implementations may be introduced in the future by contributors or core developers.
- The proposed Move API is designed to be forward-compatible with such potential native implementations.

## High-level Overview

The most straightforward alternative would be to continue relying on developers to implement their own signed integer wrappers using unsigned integers. This approach has several critical limitations:

1. **Fragmentation & Security Risks**: Each project would need to implement its own signed integer logic, leading to inconsistent behavior and increased audit complexity. Custom implementations are prone to subtle bugs in edge cases that could cause financial losses in applications.

2. **Performance Overhead**: Custom solutions incur higher gas costs than a standardized implementation at `0x1`. The straw man would force all contracts to pay for repeated bytecode execution of common arithmetic operations rather than benefiting from potential future native optimization.

This AIP's centralized implementation provides:
- **Safety**: Rigorously tested overflow handling and edge case behaviors
- **Efficiency**: Location at `0x1` eliminates module load costs, with a clear path to native optimization
- **Interoperability**: Standardized behavior across contracts
- **Maintainability**: Single implementation to audit and optimize

## Impact

1. DApp Developers

- Learn the new signed integer APIs in the standard library
- Migrate existing custom signed integer implementations to the standardized version
- Consider performance implications for math-heavy operations (until native implementation is available)

This proposal has no dependencies on other AIPs.

## Alternative Solutions

The primary alternative would be implementing signed integers natively in the Move VM. While this would provide optimal performance, it presents several challenges:

- VM Complexity: Requires extensive changes to Move VM's type system
- Deployment Timeline: Native support would take significantly longer to implement

A hybrid approach (proposed here) allows immediate availability while preserving the option for native optimization later.

## Specification and Implementation Details

The `i64` and `i128` modules provide custom implementations of 64-bit and 128-bit signed integers, respectively, in Move. They use a `bits` field to represent the internal two's complement bit pattern of each integer type and implement common arithmetic and comparison operations, mimicking the behavior of native signed integers.

#### Module structure
```
module aptos_std::i64 {
    /// Signed 64-bit integer using two's complement representation.
    struct I64 has copy, drop, store {
        bits: u64
    }

    // Arithmetic operations
    public fun add(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Adds two I64 values, aborts on overflow
    public fun sub(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Subtracts two I64 values, aborts on overflow
    public fun mul(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Multiplies two I64 values, checks overflow
    public fun div(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Divides two I64 values, rounds toward zero
    public fun mod(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Computes remainder of I64 division

    // Conversions    
    public fun from(v: u64): I64;                     /// Converts a u64 to I64, ensures v ≤ max positive
    public fun neg_from(v: u64): I64;                 /// Converts a u64 to negative I64, checks lower bound
    public fun pack(v: u64): I64;                     /// From raw u64 bits (unchecked)
    public fun unpack(self: I64): u64;                /// Returns the internal two's complement bits

    // Utility functions      
    public fun zero(): I64;                           /// Returns I64 zero
    public fun abs(self: I64): I64;                   /// Returns the absolute value of I64
    public fun min(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Returns the smaller of two I64 values
    public fun max(self: I64, b: I64): I64;           /// Returns the larger of two I64 values
    public fun cmp(self: I64, b: I64): u8;            /// Compares two I64 values: LT, EQ, or GT
    public fun eq(self: I64, num2: I64): bool;        /// Returns true if both I64 values are equal
    public fun gt(self: I64, num2: I64): bool;        /// Returns true if num1 > num2
    public fun gte(self: I64, num2: I64): bool;       /// Returns true if num1 >= num2
    public fun lt(self: I64, num2: I64): bool;        /// Returns true if num1 < num2
    public fun lte(self: I64, num2: I64): bool;       /// Returns true if num1 <= num2
    public fun pow(self: I64, exponent: u64): I64;    /// Raises I64 base to u64 exponent
}
```

## Reference Implementation

Proposed PR: [https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/16735](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/16735)

## Testing 

These modules achieve 100% test coverage and are formally verified using the Move Prover.

## Risks and Drawbacks

- This pure Move implementation is not as efficient as a native implementation.
- Developers should be aware of the execution cost, especially for functions with loops like pow().

## Future Potential

Once native support for signed integers is introduced, we can replace the current logic with native functions internally. At that point, the `i64` and `i128` modules will serve as wrappers providing additional functionality.
