# AIP-114 - Increase Coin Symbol Byte Length

## Summary

Currently, emojis are 3 bytes, and could be longer up to 32 bytes. This AIP proposes to increase the coin and FA symbol
byte length to allow for more combinations of emojis to be used as a coin symbol. This is an increase from 10 bytes to 32 bytes,
and adjusts the indexer storage accordingly.

Goal here is to allow for more flexibility in coin symbols, and to allow for more unique coin symbols to be used.

### Out of scope

> What are we committing to not doing and why are they scoped out?

Not changing anything but the number of bytes allowed to be stored, and the Aptos default indexer.

## High-level Overview

Increases the limit to 32 bytes, and adjusts the indexer storage to allow for this.

## Impact

Indexers will now need to handle the longer symbol length. Most other applications simply read, and should not have any
issues with this change.

If this proposal doesn't happen, then we will be limited to 10 bytes for coin and FA symbols.

## Alternative Solutions

None, it's currently limited to 10 bytes, there's no other way to stick with UTF-8 and allow for more emojis.

## Specification and Implementation Details

- Framework change https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/15846
- Indexer change https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-indexer-processors-v2/pull/63

## Reference Implementation

See https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/15846, increases to 32 bytes.

## Testing

Will have to test in devnet / testnet against existing indexers to ensure they can handle the longer symbol length.

## Risks and Drawbacks

Risk is some indexers may not be able to handle the longer symbol length, and may need to be updated. This could break
existing indexers that handle generic types, but should not effect indexers for things like centralized exchanges.

## Security Considerations

None

## Future Potential

None
