# AIP-X - (AIP title)
  
(Please give a temporary file name to your AIP when first drafting it, AIP manager will assign a number to it after reviewing.)

(Please leave the questions in the "quote box" and provide your answer(s) directly below them, as opposed to removing the questions and providing an answer without context to the reader. Including the question being answered as additional context should be very helpful for the reader to understand.)

## Summary

 > Summarize in 3-5 sentences what is the problem we’re solving for and how are we solving for it

### Goals

 > What are the goals and what is in scope? Any metrics?
 > Discuss the business impact and business value this change would impact.
 > 
...

### Out of Scope

 > What are we committing to not doing and why are they scoped out?

## Motivation

 > Describe the impetus for this change. What does it accomplish?
 > What might occur if we do not accept this proposal?

...

## Impact

 > Which audiences are impacted by this change? What type of action does the audience need to take?

...

## Alternative solutions

 > Explain why you submitted this proposal specifically over alternative solutions. Why is this the best possible outcome?

...

## Specification

 > How will we solve the problem? Describe in detail precisely how this proposal should be implemented. Include proposed design principles that should be followed in implementing this feature. Make the proposal specific enough to allow others to build upon it and perhaps even derive competing implementations.

...

## Reference Implementation

 > This is an optional yet highly encouraged section where you may include an example of what you are seeking in this proposal. This can be in the form of code, diagrams, or even plain text. Ideally, we have a link to a living repository of code exemplifying the standard, or, for simpler cases, inline code.

...

## Testing (Optional)

 > - What is the testing plan? (other than load testing, all tests should be part of the implementation details and won’t need to be called out)
 > - When can we expect the results?
 > - What are the test results and are they what we expected? If not, explain the gap.

...

## Risks and Drawbacks

 > - Express here the potential negative ramifications of taking on this proposal. What are the hazards?
 > - Any backwards compatibility issues we should be aware of?
 > - If there are issues, how can we mitigate or resolve them?

...

## Future Potential

 > Think through the evolution of this proposal well into the future. How do you see this playing out? What would this proposal result in in one year? In five years?

...

## Timeline

### Suggested implementation timeline

 > Describe how long you expect the implementation effort to take, perhaps splitting it up into stages or milestones.

...

### Suggested developer platform support timeline

 > Describe the plan to have SDK, API, CLI, Indexer support for this feature is applicable. 

...

### Suggested deployment timeline

 > Indicate a future release version as a *rough* estimate for when the community should expect to see this deployed on our three networks (e.g., release 1.7).
 > You are responsible for updating this AIP with a better estimate, if any, after the AIP passes the gatekeeper’s design review.

 > - On devnet?
 > - On testnet?
 > - On mainnet?

...

## Security Considerations

 > - Does this result in a change of security assumptions or our threat model?
 > - Any potential scams? What are the mitigation strategies?
 > - Any security implications/considerations?
 > - Any security design docs or auditing materials that can be shared?

## Open Questions (Optional)

 > Q&A here, some of them can have answers some of those questions can be things we have not figured out but we should
