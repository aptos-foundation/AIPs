# Aptos Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Aptos Improvement Proposals (AIPs) offer a way for the Aptos ecosystem to propose changes, improvements and modifications to the Aptos Blockchain. 

We will be sharing more about the AIP process at a later date! In the meantime, we will be putting up some AIPS for feedback, and to test out workflows.
