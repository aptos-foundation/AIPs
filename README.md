# Aptos Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

Aptos Improvement Proposals (AIP) describe standards for the Aptos Network including the core blockchain protocol and the development platform (Move), smart contracts and systems for smart contract verification, standards for the deployment and operation of the Aptos Network, APIs for accessing the Aptos Network and processing information from the Aptos Network.

## How to submit an AIP

 1. Fork this repo into your own GitHub
 2. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` into your new AIP file in `aips/<your-feature-name-NO-AIP-#-here>.md`
    + Name your AIP file based on your feature, not the AIP number, which will be picked for your later.
    + e.g., `new-zero-knowledge-range-proof-verifiers.md` is a good name.
    - ...but `aip-14.md` or `14.md` is **NOT** a good name.
 3. Edit your AIP file
    - Fill in the YAML header (see instructions there)
    - Follow the template guidelines to the best of your ability
 4. Commit these changes to your repo
 5. Submit a pull request on GitHub to this repo.
