## How to submit an AIP

 1. Fork this repo into your own GitHub
 2. Copy `TEMPLATE.md` into your new AIP file in `aips/<your-feature-name-NO-AIP-#-here>.md`
    + Name your AIP file based on your feature, not the AIP number, which will be picked for your later.
    + e.g., `new-zero-knowledge-range-proof-verifiers.md` is a good name.
    - ...but `aip-14.md` or `14.md` is **NOT** a good name.
 3. Edit your AIP file
    - Fill in the YAML header (see instructions there)
    - Follow the template guidelines to the best of your ability
 4. Commit these changes to your repo
 5. Submit a pull request on GitHub to this repo.
